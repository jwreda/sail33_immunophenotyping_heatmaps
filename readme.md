To run this code, open the Quarto markdown (`.qmd`) document in your compatible IDE of choice (e.g. RStudio), and knit the document.
The resulting `.html` report is included for the reader's convenience.

The code takes an Excel workbook (`.xlsx`) as input. Going sheet-by-sheet, the code normalizes numeric variables (unifying measurements to a shared scale) and prepares a heatmap. Metadata are used as annotations, and Euclidean clustering is performed.
